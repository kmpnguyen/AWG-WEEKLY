				<button class="week-button" id="week-2-button-3">3 <p id="week-2-button-3-p">The internet has changed a lot since then, but the DIY aesthetics and practices of that era have by no means disappeared.</p></button>
				<button class="week-button" id="week-2-button-4">4 <p id="week-2-button-4-p">Handmade objects are objects made by hand or by using simple tools rather than machines. Whether the object is homely — as in a child’s clay ashtray — or exquisite — as in a pair of bespoke brogues — the term ‘handmade’ implies a slowness in making and a unique, rare, or irregular result. <br>
				I evoke the term ‘handmade web’ to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which in some way challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or identity.</p></button>

				<button class="week-button" id="week-3-button-2">2 <p id="week-3-button-2-p">Two basic activities emerge. A person may work “on” the digital or “within” it. In the former, one’s attention is directed from the outside in, taking the medium itself as its object, while in the latter one takes the perspective of the medium itself, radiating attention outward to other contexts and environments.</p> </button>
				<button class="week-button" id="week-3-button-3">3 <p id="week-3-button-3-p">Text characters have been used for visual art for thousands of years, and seems to be gaining momentum. One reason is that digital media, by virtue of programming languages and protocols, is tightly connected to the text characters of e.g. ASCII and Unicode. Studying the foundations of digital media, often indirectly means to study flows of text characters - just like in the Matrix, according to some. Another reason is what Reynolds (2011) calls retromania, the large-scale cultural development that re-approaches previously popular forms of expressions in order to explore “new” options.</p> </button>

This, at the time was (and perhaps for some still is), quite radical because it called into question the very concept of what an artwork could be and challenged the role of the artist. It is this work that is now being more widely acknowledged as some of the earliest examples of conceptual art.</p></button>

It creates a space for interaction through new forms of communication with a co-player. </p></button>
				<button class="week-button" id="week-5-button-7">6 <p id="week-5-button-7-p">The game enables a collaborative exercise that promotes recognition and respect for the other, and material literacy. The first pieces of the board are produced by a laser cutter. The pieces are then contained in a press-fit box and canvas wrap which has engraved instructions upon it. Inside, you can also find the ‘Generator’. The generator allows the players to create their own pieces with DIY cooked biomaterials (the pieces and generator can be customised).</p></button>

Basically playing with language, information and rules.

Not only so, this reading remind me of the experiment made by MIT researcher where they conduct a radicial and gender experiement between black and white, man and woman on AI to find out AI are more likely to response to white man among all factors.
